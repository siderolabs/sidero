# Server Classes

Server classes are a way to group distinct server resources.  The "qualifiers"
key allows the administrator to specify criteria upon which to group these
servers.  There are currently four keys: `cpu`, `systemInformation`,
`labelSelectors`, and `labelSelector`.  Each of these keys accepts a list of
entries.  The top level keys are a "logical AND", while the lists under each
key are a "logical OR".  Qualifiers that are not specified are not evaluated.

An example:

```yaml
apiVersion: metal.sidero.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ServerClass
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  qualifiers:
    cpu:
      - manufacturer: Intel(R) Corporation
        version: Intel(R) Atom(TM) CPU C3558 @ 2.20GHz
      - manufacturer: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
        version: AMD Ryzen 7 2700X Eight-Core Processor
    labelSelectors:
      - my-server-label: true
    labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        foo: bar
      matchExpressions:
        - key: topology.kubernetes.io/region
          operator: In
          values:
            - central
            - east
        - key: environment
          operator: NotIn
          values:
            - prod
```

Servers would only be added to the above class if they had _EITHER_ CPU info,
_AND_ the label associated with the server resource.
