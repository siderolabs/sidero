                  are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when
                  embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which
                  are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                  are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                  is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most
                  embedded usages, there are particular restrictions like, "must refer
                  only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                  Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because
                  the usages are different, the validation rules are different by
                  usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                  4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not
                  a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                  and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on
                  the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct is
                  irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is
                  embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect numerous
                  schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed an underspecified API type
